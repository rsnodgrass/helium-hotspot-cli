# helium-hotspot-cli

Simple command-line interface for common administration tools for hotspots that
expose management APIs.

**PLEASE CONTRIBUTE! This was just created as an easy way to manage hotspots
while onboarding them where automating the update/management of a large number
of hotspots is best done with CLI tools.**

## Installation

Every command comes with a built in `--help` option, which explains how to use it.
